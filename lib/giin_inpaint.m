function [ G, pixels, Pstructure, Pinformation ] = giin_inpaint( G, pixels, patches, gparam, liveplot )
%GIIN_INPAINT Inpaint a signal and update the corresponding graph.
%   Usage :
%       G = giin_inpaint( G, pixels, patches, gparam, liveplot )
%       [ G, pixels ] = giin_inpaint( G, pixels, patches, gparam, liveplot )
%       [ G, pixels, Pstructure, Pinformation ] = giin_inpaint( G, pixels, patches, gparam, liveplot )
%
%   Input parameters :
%       G        : GSPbox graph structure
%       pixels   : pixel signal
%       patches  : patch signal (could be created)
%       gparam   : parameter structure
%       liveplot : true to plot the process evolution
%
%   Output parameters :
%       G            : retrieved graph
%       pixels       : updated pixel signal
%       Pstructure   : priority signal according to structure
%       Pinformation : priority signal according to information / confidence
